    "\n",
    "###  **Basic-Level Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is a REST API?**  \n",
    "   A REST API (Representational State Transfer) is a web service that follows REST principles, allowing clients to access and manipulate resources using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What are the main HTTP methods used in REST?**  \n",
    "   - `GET`: Retrieve data  \n",
    "   - `POST`: Create new data  \n",
    "   - `PUT`: Update existing data  \n",
    "   - `PATCH`: Partially update data  \n",
    "   - `DELETE`: Remove data\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What is the difference between `PUT` and `PATCH`?**  \n",
    "   - `PUT` replaces the entire resource.  \n",
    "   - `PATCH` updates only the specified fields of a resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What is the purpose of status codes like 200, 201, 400, 404, and 500?**  \n",
    "   - `200 OK`: Successful request  \n",
    "   - `201 Created`: Resource created  \n",
    "   - `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input  \n",
    "   - `404 Not Found`: Resource not found  \n",
    "   - `500 Internal Server Error`: Server-side issue\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What is the difference between REST and RESTful?**  \n",
    "   REST is the architectural style; RESTful refers to APIs that fully follow REST principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **Intermediate-Level Questions**\n",

    "6. **How do you handle authentication in a REST API?**  \n",
    "   Common methods include:\n",
    "   - API keys\n",
    "   - Basic Auth\n",
    "   - OAuth2\n",
    "   - JWT (JSON Web Tokens)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **What is the role of request headers and response headers?**  \n",
    "   Headers carry metadata like content type, authentication tokens, and caching policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **How do you validate incoming JSON data in a Python REST API?**  \n",
    "   In FastAPI, you use **Pydantic models** to validate and parse JSON data automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **What is CORS and how do you handle it in a REST API?**  \n",
    "   CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) controls which domains can access your API. In FastAPI, you can use `CORSMiddleware` to configure it.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **How do you implement pagination in a REST API?**  \n",
    "   By using query parameters like `?page=2&limit=10` and returning paginated results with metadata (total count, next page, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "###  **Advanced-Level Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **How do you design a RESTful API for a billing system?**  \n",
    "   - Identify resources (e.g., `/customers`, `/invoices`, `/payments`)  \n",
    "   - Use proper HTTP methods  \n",
    "   - Secure endpoints with authentication  \n",
    "   - Validate inputs and handle errors  \n",
    "   - Use versioning (`/api/v1/`)\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **How do you handle rate limiting in your API?**  \n",
    "   Use tools like:\n",
    "   - API gateways (e.g., Kong, NGINX)\n",
    "   - Middleware (e.g., `slowapi` in FastAPI)\n",
    "   - Custom logic with Redis or in-memory counters\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **What are idempotent methods and why are they important?**  \n",
    "   Idempotent methods (like `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) produce the same result no matter how many times they are called. This ensures safe retries and predictable behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **How do you version your REST APIs?**  \n",
    "   Common methods:\n",
    "   - URL versioning: `/api/v1/users`\n",

    "   - Use HTTPS  \n",
    "   - Validate and sanitize inputs  \n",
    "   - Implement authentication and authorization  \n",

    "What is Pagination in APIs?\n",
    "Pagination is a technique used in APIs to split large sets of data into smaller chunks (pages). Instead of returning thousands of records in one response, the API returns a limited number (e.g., 10, 50, 100) per request.\n",

    "Improves performance and response time\n",

    "Makes data easier to navigate for users\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Great follow-up! Let’s break down **how pagination improves performance, reduces memory usage, and enhances usability** — with simple explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  1. **Improves Performance and Response Time**\n",
    "\n",
    "Without pagination:\n",
    "- The server might return **thousands of records** in one response.\n",
    "- This takes **longer to process**, **longer to send**, and **longer for the client to receive and render**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With pagination:\n",
    "- The server returns only a **small chunk** (e.g., 10 or 50 records).\n",
    "- This makes the response **faster**, and the client can **start displaying data immediately**.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Example**: A billing dashboard loads 10 invoices instantly instead of waiting for 10,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  2. **Reduces Memory Usage on Both Client and Server**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Server**: Doesn’t need to load and serialize the entire dataset at once.\n",
    "- **Client**: Doesn’t need to hold all data in memory — just the current page.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Example**: A mobile app fetching only 20 records per page uses less RAM and battery.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  3. **Makes Data Easier to Navigate for Users**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Users can **scroll or click through pages** instead of being overwhelmed by a huge list.\n",
    "- Improves **user experience** and **readability**.\n",

    "###  Why Social Media Apps Use Pagination\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance**: Loading thousands of posts, comments, or messages at once would slow down the app and consume too much memory.\n",
    "2. **User Experience**: Pagination allows users to scroll through content smoothly (infinite scroll is a form of pagination).\n",
    "3. **Bandwidth Optimization**: Only a small chunk of data is sent at a time, reducing network load.\n",
    "4. **Backend Efficiency**: The server only queries and returns a limited number of records per request.\n",
