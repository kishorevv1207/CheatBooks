    "###  6. **Error Handling**\n",
    "- Proper **status codes** and messages help clients understand what went wrong.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **Basic-Level Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is a REST API?**  \n",
    "   A REST API (Representational State Transfer) is a web service that follows REST principles, allowing clients to access and manipulate resources using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What are the main HTTP methods used in REST?**  \n",
    "   - `GET`: Retrieve data  \n",
    "   - `POST`: Create new data  \n",
    "   - `PUT`: Update existing data  \n",
    "   - `PATCH`: Partially update data  \n",
    "   - `DELETE`: Remove data\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What is the difference between `PUT` and `PATCH`?**  \n",
    "   - `PUT` replaces the entire resource.  \n",
    "   - `PATCH` updates only the specified fields of a resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What is the purpose of status codes like 200, 201, 400, 404, and 500?**  \n",
    "   - `200 OK`: Successful request  \n",
    "   - `201 Created`: Resource created  \n",
    "   - `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input  \n",
    "   - `404 Not Found`: Resource not found  \n",
    "   - `500 Internal Server Error`: Server-side issue\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What is the difference between REST and RESTful?**  \n",
    "   REST is the architectural style; RESTful refers to APIs that fully follow REST principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **Intermediate-Level Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **How do you handle authentication in a REST API?**  \n",
    "   Common methods include:\n",
    "   - API keys\n",
    "   - Basic Auth\n",
    "   - OAuth2\n",
    "   - JWT (JSON Web Tokens)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **What is the role of request headers and response headers?**  \n",
    "   Headers carry metadata like content type, authentication tokens, and caching policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **How do you validate incoming JSON data in a Python REST API?**  \n",
    "   In FastAPI, you use **Pydantic models** to validate and parse JSON data automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **What is CORS and how do you handle it in a REST API?**  \n",
    "   CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) controls which domains can access your API. In FastAPI, you can use `CORSMiddleware` to configure it.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **How do you implement pagination in a REST API?**  \n",
    "   By using query parameters like `?page=2&limit=10` and returning paginated results with metadata (total count, next page, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **Advanced-Level Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **How do you design a RESTful API for a billing system?**  \n",
    "   - Identify resources (e.g., `/customers`, `/invoices`, `/payments`)  \n",
    "   - Use proper HTTP methods  \n",
    "   - Secure endpoints with authentication  \n",
    "   - Validate inputs and handle errors  \n",
    "   - Use versioning (`/api/v1/`)\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **How do you handle rate limiting in your API?**  \n",
    "   Use tools like:\n",
    "   - API gateways (e.g., Kong, NGINX)\n",
    "   - Middleware (e.g., `slowapi` in FastAPI)\n",
    "   - Custom logic with Redis or in-memory counters\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **What are idempotent methods and why are they important?**  \n",
    "   Idempotent methods (like `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) produce the same result no matter how many times they are called. This ensures safe retries and predictable behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **How do you version your REST APIs?**  \n",
    "   Common methods:\n",
    "   - URL versioning: `/api/v1/users`\n",

    "   - Use HTTPS  \n",
    "   - Validate and sanitize inputs  \n",
    "   - Implement authentication and authorization  \n",

    "What is Pagination in APIs?\n",
    "Pagination is a technique used in APIs to split large sets of data into smaller chunks (pages). Instead of returning thousands of records in one response, the API returns a limited number (e.g., 10, 50, 100) per request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use Pagination?\n",
    "\n",
    "Improves performance and response time\n",
    "Reduces memory usage on both client and server\n",
    "Makes data easier to navigate for users\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Great follow-up! Let’s break down **how pagination improves performance, reduces memory usage, and enhances usability** — with simple explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 1. **Improves Performance and Response Time**\n",
    "\n",
    "Without pagination:\n",
    "- The server might return **thousands of records** in one response.\n",
    "- This takes **longer to process**, **longer to send**, and **longer for the client to receive and render**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With pagination:\n",
    "- The server returns only a **small chunk** (e.g., 10 or 50 records).\n",
    "- This makes the response **faster**, and the client can **start displaying data immediately**.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Example**: A billing dashboard loads 10 invoices instantly instead of waiting for 10,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 2. **Reduces Memory Usage on Both Client and Server**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Server**: Doesn’t need to load and serialize the entire dataset at once.\n",
    "- **Client**: Doesn’t need to hold all data in memory — just the current page.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Example**: A mobile app fetching only 20 records per page uses less RAM and battery.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 3. **Makes Data Easier to Navigate for Users**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Users can **scroll or click through pages** instead of being overwhelmed by a huge list.\n",
    "- Improves **user experience** and **readability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Example**: E-commerce sites show 20 products per page with “Next” and “Previous” buttons.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Performance**: Loading thousands of posts, comments, or messages at once would slow down the app and consume too much memory.\n",
    "2. **User Experience**: Pagination allows users to scroll through content smoothly (infinite scroll is a form of pagination).\n",
    "3. **Bandwidth Optimization**: Only a small chunk of data is sent at a time, reducing network load.\n",
    "4. **Backend Efficiency**: The server only queries and returns a limited number of records per request.\n",
