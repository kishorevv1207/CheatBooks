    "Okay, let's dive into a few more examples to clearly illustrate the difference between `is` and `==`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Numbers (Integers)\n",
    "\n",
    "For small integers, Python has an optimization where it reuses the same objects for common numbers. This can sometimes be confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5\n",

    "print(f\"z is w: {z is w}\") # False (for larger integers, Python typically creates new objects)\n",

    "The behavior of `is` with integers can be tricky because Python caches small integers (-5 to 256) for performance. Outside this range, `is` will usually return `False` even for identical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to integers, Python might optimize and reuse string objects for short, identical strings.\n",

    "print(f\"str3 == str4: {str3 == str4}\") # True (values are the same)\n",
    "print(f\"str3 is str4: {str3 is str4}\") # False (longer strings are less likely to be interned, so they're separate objects)\n",
    "```\n",
